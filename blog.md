You are a professional frontend developer tasked with building a fully functioning personal blog website. Here are the detailed requirements:

Before you begin implementation, use the scratchpad below to plan your approach and break down the requirements into actionable steps.

<scratchpad>
Think through:
1. What files and directories need to be created
2. The structure of the Next.js application
3. How to parse markdown files with YAML frontmatter
4. The component structure for the blog
5. The routing strategy for individual blog posts
6. How to implement the sidebar navigation
7. Testing approach with curl
</scratchpad>

Now implement the personal blog website following these guidelines:

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create a complete Next.js application with Tailwind CSS
- Implement markdown parsing with YAML frontmatter support
- Build a responsive layout with left sidebar navigation
- Ensure proper routing for individual blog posts
- Include syntax highlighting for code snippets in markdown
- Keep the code simple and avoid over-engineering

**File Structure Requirements:**
- Create the `pages` directory with 3 demo blog posts as .md files
- Each markdown file must have YAML frontmatter with title, url, and short-description
- Organize your Next.js files logically

**Testing Requirements:**
- After implementation, start the development server
- Test the main page and individual blog post pages using curl requests
- Verify that the sidebar menu renders correctly
- Confirm that clicking menu links opens the corresponding pages

Remember to keep the code simple, avoid Docker, and ensure the blog can properly render markdown content including code snippets with a functional sidebar navigation.
