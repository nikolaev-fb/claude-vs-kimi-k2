# Tailwind CSS Tips

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework.

## Flexbox

Flexbox is easy with Tailwind:

```html
<div class="flex items-center justify-center h-screen bg-gray-100">
  <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow">
    Centered Content
  </div>
</div>
```

## Typography plugin

Don't forget to install `@tailwindcss/typography` for rendering markdown content nicely!
