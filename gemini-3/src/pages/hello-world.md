# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is the first post.

I am exciting to share my thoughts on:
- Frontend development
- React and Next.js
- CSS tips

Here is a simple code snippet in JavaScript:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
